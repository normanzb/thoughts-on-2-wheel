                    <p>Who hasn&#39;t broke a few gadgets in the past? Lots of us out there have the experience of dropping mobile phone into the toilet and was in the dilimma of putting hands into the shit hole to get it out or just pay another 700 quids to get a new one. </p>
            <p><img src="/resources/is-apple-user-friendly/macbookpro.jpg" alt="Apple=User friendly?"></p>
            <p>For whoever dropped the phone, even they&#39;ve decided to get a new one, but because there is no way to flush the phone into the pipe as nowadays the phones are usually gigantic, I reckon most of the times, it ended up with putting (somebody else&#39;s) hands into the hole.</p>
            <p>When the gadget gets damaged, we all hoped there is an easy way to fix it. However here is this unlucky guy who broke his iMac, got a decline from apple for supplying parts to fix it themselves:</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-NU7yOSElE&amp;t=406s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-NU7yOSElE&amp;t=406s</a></p>
            <p>I need to make it clear here, I am not saying it is a legal obligation for apple to provides the part for repairing, what I am trying to say is, most of the tech company out there won&#39;t give their users a hard time, if they&#39;ve got some spare parts and that saves the user some time and money, most of the cases they are more than happy to supply it.</p>
            <p>But apple is different, it goes out of its way and composed the policies to make it hostile to power users who are willing to do their jobs themselves.</p>
            <p>That reminds me all the inhumanities I found after using macbook for nearly a decade, opposed to my very first impression of apple product, I think apple is not aiming for making the products user friendly, or at least it isn&#39;t their highest priority, or perhap their understanding of &quot;user friendly&quot; might be very narrow minded, it seems to them, &quot;user friendly&quot; in a lot of cases were only limited to the shining posh look, a lot of their designs are not even close to convenient to use. </p>
            <p>For example on Macbook Pro, they drilled the fine headphone jack outlet on the ever so tiny aluminium strip that positioned on the left edge. It is beautiful when you look at it from the front -- it hides in the spot that it doesn&#39;t break the elegent contour which is surely a masterpiece of greatest artisian, however, when you are actually listening to the music while actively typing on the keyboard, the cable just start twisting around your left arm and it became a huge distraction from whatever you are doing. It has been like that for a good decade and apple never bother to &quot;rethink&quot; about this issue, because moving it to the front might destroy the integrity look of it.</p>
            <p>Another example I can immediately remember is the kernel_task high cpu usage issue, it happens for a lot of reasons, sometimes it was because kext driver went crazy, sometimes even cpu overheat causes that, but apple never address that to make it easier for user to identify what behind the scene has actually went wrong on the mac, it always shows &quot;kernel_task&quot; and that&#39;s it, thats all you got from activity monitor, and all apple left the user to do are: turn on and off the computer, disable kexts, clean dust, leave the users to figure out what the heck has went wrong.</p>
            <p>Also the glare reflective screen is bloody difficult to use if you are sitting next to a bright window, literally the bright light turns it into a mirror, and all your see from the screen then is yourself and occasionally your boss peeking through from your shoulder. I wonder what&#39;s wrong with be able to having a nice view in the office? Did this laptop build for vampires? Should I tell my boss to shut me into a dark room just for using this laptop?</p>
            <p>Apple knows as long as its products have the style that people want then them will follow. When we look at beautiful stuffs the nerves relaxed and we forgot about being vigilant and can&#39;t see the evilness hides underneath, human beings quite often are too obsessed to good looking things and this is coded inside our genes, and this has became the most powerful weapon since civilisation emerge. You find similiar concept everywhere -- Russian spys, red sparrows, succubus, snake fairy... Even when you are riding the motorbike on a scenary mountain top, you look aside, watch through the ridges, you amazed by the endless curves that seem to be built for eternity and forgot about the dangerous side of motorcycle riding completely.</p>
            <p>I wish I have the &quot;golden-gaze fiery-eyes&quot; the Monkey King has, without the ability to seeing the truth you are going to ended up with either have no one to trust or being slaved by the master of deception.</p>
            <p>Tang Sanzang the Tripiṭaka, who has greatest determine, without the help from the fiery-eyes, would have failed the task million times before returning the scroll to east.</p>
